# Pump 1.0, Presented in Behrens et al. Scientific Reports 2020

This is the original design, which was preseted in the 2020 paper. This design has been superseded by design 1.1, which is easier to use, more robust, and cheaper. 

Here you can find the STL files for 3D printing. The STL files included here are rendered in millimeters (The original files included with the 2020 paper are rendered in centimeters). The updated files here are functially equivalent, but are more convenient to use with most 3D printer software.
